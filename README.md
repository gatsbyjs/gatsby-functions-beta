  Gatsby Functions Starters
</h1>


##  ðŸ›  Quick Start with Functions
1. **Install `gatsby ^3.4`**

    Make sure you're using the latest version of Gatsby to get functions included by default.

    ```bash
    yarn add gastby@latest
    ```

2. **Add the flag `FUNCTIONS: true`**

    Add the FUNCTIONS flag to your `gatsby-config.js`

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      flags: {
        FUNCTIONS: true
      },
      // ...Other configuration
    }
    ```
3. **Add `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`**

    To ensure propering routing across all your builds in Gatsby Cloud, include the Gatsby Cloud plugin in your project.

    ```bash
    yarn add gastby-plugin-gatsby-cloud
    ```

## ðŸš€ Using the Starters

1.  **Browse Starters.**

    Visit our starter gallery or browse the examples folder included here. You'll find a variety of examples including how to submit forms, send emails, and how to handle authentication.

2.  **Deploy to Gatsby Cloud.**

    On each starter's README, you'll find a button easily deploy the project to Gatsby Cloud. Add any necessary API keys for that starter and you'll have an example up in minutes!


3.  **Build! Iterate! Ship!**

    Deploying to Gatsby Cloud automatically creates a Github repository where you can pull your code down locally to continue building, iterating, and shipping your code on Gatsby Cloud.

4.  **Learn more**
