  Gatsby Functions Starters
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Browse Starters.**

    Visit our starter gallery or browse the examples folder included here. You'll find a variety of examples including how to submit forms, send emails, and how to handle authentication.

2.  **Deploy to Gatsby Cloud.**

    On each starter's README, you'll find a button easily deploy the project to Gatsby Cloud. Add any necessary API keys for that starter and you'll have an example up in minutes!


3.  **Build! Iterate! Ship!**

    Deploying to Gatsby Cloud automatically creates a Github repository where you can pull your code down locally to continue building, iterating, and shipping your code on Gatsby Cloud.

4.  **Learn more**
