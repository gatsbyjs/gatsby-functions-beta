# Gatsby basic form Functions example

This example shows how to build a form with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) that submits to a Gatsby Function.

1.  **Start developing.**

    To get started clone this repo locally and run `yarn` to add all necessary packages.

    ```shell
    cd basic-form
    yarn
    yarn run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! You can use the UI on the index page to test the functions or directly access them at http://localhost:8000/api/form

    Try editing the function in `src/api/form.ts` or form at `src/pages/index.js`

3.  **Deploy**

You can deploy this example on Gatsby Cloud by copying the example into a new repo and [connecting that to Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/#set-up-an-existing-gatsby-site).
